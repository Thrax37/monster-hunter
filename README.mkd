# Monster Hunter Binary Decoder

In progress work to decode monster hunter binary files and output them as something more useful. Right now it's less useful, but give me a second.

## Building

```bash
cargo build
```

## Running

```bash
monster-hunter decode save <path to save file>
```

## Example

Right now I just write a text representation of the underlying data out to stdout. Here is a link to some example output. https://gist.github.com/aconbere/57cb47491804d9799c8b
